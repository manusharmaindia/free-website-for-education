Python programming uses indentation nda spaces instead of brackets.
Python 3 and Python commonly known as python are different, python 3 is a seprate coding language it is not a version of python.

Now we will see some common task
Declaring variable in python 3, we not need to declare a seprate variable like in c++ like int num;
in python 3 just passing value is enough like i = 3 enough it will automatically take 3 as a integer.

Defining a function in python 3
Very easy just 
def function name :
  "your function code here in indentation"
